### Boston's broadcast history, in its original form

The WGBH Archives 

Now, in collaboration with Olin College, the Archives are brought to life in a form that uses "new" tech to broadcast archival content in its original display format. 

Our low-power broadcast system allows classic content to be broadcast to vintage, analog television sets, giving a warm, nostalgic aesthetic to visual media from past decades. This installation serves to:

 * __Highlight the rich history of broadcast by institutions in the Boston area:__ The WGBH Archives have preserved decades from WGBH, as well as __, __, and Cambridge Community TV. *Archives Over the Air* will not only show the public that the Archives exist, but it will also highlight various Boston area-produced programs and segments, connecting them to various historical events and contexts in both Boston and in public broadcasting as a whole.
 * __Display media in its original context:__ By transmitting over analog airwaves to vintage TV sets, our installation recreates one component of television watching as a cultural phenomenon. Vintage TV sets have an aesthetic that is inherently warm, tactile, and inviting, providing an opportunity for intergenerational connection as younger generations experience a new form of interaction.
