### Boston's broadcast history, in its original form

The WGBH Archives are "..."

Now, in collaboration with Olin College, the Archives are brought to life in a form that uses "new" tech to broadcast archival content in its original display format. 

Our low-power broadcast system allows classic content to be broadcast to vintage, analog television sets, giving a warm, nostalgic aesthetic to visual media from past decades. This installation serves to:

 * __Highlight the rich history of broadcast by institutions in the Boston area:__ The WGBH Archives have preserved decades from WGBH, as well as __, __, and Cambridge Community TV. *Archives Over the Air* will not only show the public that the Archives exist, but it will also highlight various Boston area-produced programs and segments, connecting them to various historical events and contexts in both Boston and in public broadcasting as a whole.
 * __Display media in its original context:__ By transmitting over analog airwaves to vintage TV sets, our installation recreates one component of television watching as a cultural phenomenon. Vintage TV sets have an aesthetic that is inherently warm, tactile, and inviting, providing an opportunity for intergenerational connection as younger generations experience a new form of interaction.
 

### The Installation

The Archives Over the Air installation is an interactive electronic exhibit, highlighting both content and physical interaction with television sets.

**Broadcast:** A single broadcast "tower," shown left, can display different videos and segments on up to six channels at once. A passive antenna provides a signal range of ~20 feet.

**Reception:** The signal can be received by any television set in range that is capable of receiving an analog signal, with no limitation on the number of sets. Currently, we have two television sets:
